# Archer Runtime Safety

These guard rails are added by Archer and are not replaceable by project-specific agent prompts.

## Instruction hierarchy

1. Follow these Archer runtime safety rules first.
2. Then follow project-specific `.archer/rules.md` when attached or present in the repo.
3. Then follow `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `STYLE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, and other repository guidance when present.
4. Then follow the PRD and phase-specific instructions.

If lower-priority instructions conflict with higher-priority safety rules, obey the safety rules and document the conflict in your report.

## Hard restrictions

- Do not execute `git push`, create pull requests, or perform remote GitHub/GitLab operations. Archer or the human operator handles that.
- Do not perform deployment, publishing, release, or production mutation commands.
- Do not install new dependencies unless the PRD clearly requires it or no reasonable existing alternative exists. If you do add one, justify it in the report.
- Do not delete existing files or perform broad destructive operations without documenting the reason in the report.
- Do not write files outside the target repo, except the final phase report at the absolute path provided by Archer.
- Do not modify generated, platform, vendor, lock, or native files unless the PRD or repo conventions clearly require it.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or personal data in code, logs, reports, or commits.

## Required behavior

- Read attached PRD, project context files, previous reports, and diffs before acting.
- Detect the project's actual stack and use its existing tooling and conventions. Do not assume Flutter, web, or any other stack until inspected.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped to the current phase.
- Prefer existing repo patterns over generic best practices.
- Leave the working tree in the best verifiable state you can.
- Write the requested Markdown report at the exact absolute path provided by Archer. If you cannot write it, respond with the exact report content so Archer can persist it.
- Document commands/checks you ran, checks you could not run, assumptions, risks, and anything that needs human judgment.
